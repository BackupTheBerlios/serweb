				STUN 
		Simple Traversal of UDP over NAT.

This file contains information about the requirements and procedures
to use the STUN implementation.

For any bugs or problems please contact Peter Thermos at :

*************************************************************************
		REQUIREMENTS

In order to run the code you will need to download and install
Java Runtime Environment 1.4 or later from 
	http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4/download.html


If you want to recompile the code then you will need to download
and install the Java 2 comipler from the same site as mentioned
above.

		EXECUTION

This implementation includes the STUN server and client that 
is required by a multimedia application to use in order to detect
it's NAT settings.


[Server options]
The server provides the following options:

	[-p] Sets the local server port, if the default port is used or undesired
	     for use.

	[-s] Configures the STUN server to communicate with another STUN server
	     in order to help respond when a cleint sends a request with the
	     "change-address" attribute set. In such case the current STUN server
	     will send another request to the consigurted remote STN server, using the 
	     "-s" option,  with the "RESPONSE-ADDRESS" set to the client IP address
	     so the remote STUN server can properly route the response.

	[-r] Set's ythe remote STUN server's port to communicate.

	[-d] Generate debbuging messages.

	[-h] Help, this listing.
	

[Running The Server]
	
	To run the server you need to execute the following command:
	
	(Assuming that your runtime environment binaries are
	in c:\jdk1.4\bin\java.)

	c:\jdk1.4\bin\java STUNd

	You will see a response such as:
	[local IP] STUN Server listening on port 1221

	The server will start at the default port 1221. 
	You may specify an alternate port by issuing the -p option at the command line.
	For example:
	
	c:\jdk1.4\bin\java STUNd -p 2000
	
	You will see a response such as:
	[local IP] STUN Server listening on port 2000




[Running The Client]
The client has two modes of execution:

	a) Automatic discovery: In this mode the client performs various tests
	   to identify what type of NAT configuration exists.

	b) Options mode: In this mode the controling application can invoke the client
	   with various options. Some of the options are not required or in some cases
	   not permited to be send by the client, but they can be used for testing purposes.

	To run the client you need to execute the following command:
	
	(Assuming that your runtime environment binaries are
	in c:\jdk1.4\bin\java.)

	c:\jdk1.4\bin\java STUNClient -a -s127.0.0.1 -p1221

	Where -a incidates "automatic discovery", -s indicates the destination IP address 
	of the STUN server and -p1221 is its port.


[Client options]


	[-d] Turn Debugging messages on.
	[-a] Automates the discovery of NAT's based on the STUN proposal algorithm.
	[-h] Help, this listing.
	[-x] Turn on REPORT MODE. Additional messages are printed on stdout.
	[-n] Number of times to resend a STUN message to a STUN server.
     	     The Default is 9 times.
	[-f] Set the FLAGS in a STUN message
     	     The available flags are:
    		1 - set the change-IP flag
    		2 - set the change-port flag
    		3 - Discard
    		4 - set change port and IP
	
	Set the type of flag in a STUN message. Available coices are:
	[-m]    MAPPED-ADDRESS
	[-r]    RESPONSE-ADDRESS     
	[-o]    SOURCE-ADDRESS 
    	
	These flags require three parameters 
    		1) port - the remote port to send the STUN response
    		2) family - The address familiy 1 for IPv4, 2 for IPv6
    		3) IP address - the remote IP address to send the STUN response
    
	No spaces are required in between  when setting these parameters, only a comma 
    	for example, -r 1221,1,127.0.0.1  where 
	1221      = port 
 	1 	  = family 
	127.0.0.1 = IP


When you run the client it will print various responses based on the options that were
supplied when it was invoked. The typical output from a STUN request is as follows:

		<IP address>[space]<port>[space]<NAT Type (*) >
         
 
	(*) Where NAT type is substitued by:
          	FC = full cone
      	  	RC = Restricted Cone
	      	PR = Port restricted cone
          	SN = Symmetric NAT
		NN = Not behind NAT
		NU = No UDP accesibility
