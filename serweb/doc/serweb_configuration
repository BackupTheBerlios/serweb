                     Introduction into serweb configuration
                     **************************************
                     
Serweb configuration is separated into some files which are located in directory
config:

 - config.php                 - contain main configuration variables
 - config_data_layer.php      - configuration of data storage. Contain values as
                                connection to DB, names of tables in DB etc.
 - config_lang.php            - internationalization - contain avaiable languages
 - config_paths.php           - contain paths to directories used by serweb
 - set_domain.php             - short script used for obtain domain under which 
                                serweb is running
 - config_domain_defaults.php - default values of configuration variables which
                                could differentiate for each domain

Execept this configuration there is also configuration for domains. This can
be found in directory html/domains/<name of domain> or in html/domains/_default
if serweb not running in multidomain setup. 

If you need change some domain specific config values and not useing multidomain
setup, or useing serweb for more domains but the settings for all domains is 
same, you shuld change this setting simply in html/domains/_default.
Otherwise if you useing serweb for more domains and the setting for each domain 
is different, you should create subdirectories in directory html/domains named
by names of domains and copy to them content of _default directory.

Files in the html/domains/_default directory:
config.php                               - domain specific config variables
styles.css                               - CSS styles used by serweb
prolog.html, epilog.html, separator.html - HTML documents surrounding
                               these may typically include banner, trailers,
		                       and whatever else appropriate to your web design; 
                    		   the files should include at least:
                                   prolog: <body> or <body><h1>, etc.
		                           separator: may be empty, or </h1><hr> etc.
                                   epilog: </body>

directory img
 Contain images which can be used as background in CSS styles etc.

directory txt
 Contain text files. Directory txt contain subdirectories for single languages
and them contain text files which are for example emails sended by serweb etc.

The format of this files is:
- Lines starting by # on and only on the begining of the file are comments.
- Follows headers and body separated by ampty line from headers. If the file 
  does not contain headers, there must be at least one empty line before body.
  
The file may also contain some special strings quoted by '#@#' (for example:
'#@#domain#@#'). Which are replaced by some another values. It is described 
in each text file.
