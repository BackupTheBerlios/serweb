                           SERWEB Customization guide
                           **************************

Structure of html generated by serweb
=====================================

 The easiest way how to change apperance of serweb is change CSS styles. Let's
me describe structure of generated html code:

The first line of output is DOCTYPE. It may be:
<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-strict.dtd">
or
<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN">
or none. Depends on config variable 'html_doctype'

Follows html head. There can be changed only content of tag 'title'. It depends
on config varible 'html_title'. If you aren't satisfied with html head section,
you can extent it via config variables 'html_headers_0', 'html_headers_1', etc..

Following content of file prolog.html (usualy <body><h1>) and title of page. The 
title can be disabled by config variable 'display_page_heading'. Follows content
of file separator.html (usualy </h1><hr>).

All of mentioned above is done in file html/page.php, so you can study it for 
more details. Let's describe the rest of generated code:

After separator.html always following '<div class="swMain">' containing whole
serweb content. I will describe it in next section.  When the <div> tag ends
is followed by content of file epilog.html. Some javascript may follow and 
</html> tag is on the end.


Description of content of <div class="swMain"> tag
==================================================

Content of this tag is fully customizable via smarty templates. Smarty templates 
will be described bellow. Now I describe the default situation when smarty 
templates are not customized:

At the begining is usualy name of logged user (tag: <div class="swHeadingUser">...</div>)
and logout link (tag: <div class="swHeadingLogout"><a href="...">...</a></div>).

Following: 	<br class="cleaner" /><br />

If page not contain tabs <div id="swContentNoTabs"> follows. Otherwise tabs
are printed following by <div id="swContent">.

	The structure of serweb tabs
	----------------------------

	The structure is this (the first tab is selected):
	
	<div id="swTabs"><ul>
		<li id="swActiveTab"><div class="swTabsL"></div><strong><span>name of tab1</span></strong><div class="swTabsR"></div></li>
		<li><div class="swTabsL"></div><a href="..."  class="tabl"><span>name of tab2</span></a><div class="swTabsR"></div></li>
		<li><div class="swTabsL"></div><a href="..."  class="tabl"><span>name of tab3</span></a><div class="swTabsR"></div></li>
				.
				.
				.
	</ul></div>

The content of next div ('swContent' or 'swContentNoTabs') begins by display
errors and messages if there are any. If isn't <br /> is printed.

Errors are printed as list of <div> tags:
	<div class="errors">error message</div>

Mesagges are printed also as list of <div> tags:
	<div class="message">messages</div>

Notice: messages are announcement like: "Values are saved succesfully" etc.

The tags described above are in the file templates/_head.tpl. So you can study 
it for details.

The rest of page depends on the tab. There ususualy are:

	Titles
	------
	<h2 class="swTitle">title</h2>
	
	Forms
	-----
	Structure of forms is like this below. Forms are inside <div class="swForm">
	and always useing tables for formating.
	
	<div class="swForm">
	<form name='' method='POST' action='' target='_self'>
	<table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center">
	<tr>
	    <td><label for="field1">attribute name:</label></td>
	    <td><input name='field1' id='field1' value="" type='text' maxlength='32' size='16'></td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
	    <td><label for="field2">default value:</label></td>
	    <td><input name='field2' id='field2' value="" type='text' maxlength='255' size='16'></td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
	    <td align="left">&nbsp;</td>
	    <td align="right"><input name='okey' value='' type='image' src='....' border='0' alt='Save'></td>
	</tr>
	</table>
	</form></div>
	
	notice: on some places (usualy in admin interface) are used forms with 
		the fields arranged in one line. This forms are inside this 
		tag: <div class="swForm swHorizontalForm">
		
	
	Tables containing result of search
	----------------------------------
	
	<table border="1" cellpadding="1" cellspacing="0" align="center" class="swTable">
	<tr><th>......</th><th>.....</th></tr>
	<tr valign="top" class="swTrOdd"><td>......</td><td><a href="....">......</a></td></tr>
	<tr valign="top" class="swTrEven"><td>......</td><td><a href="....">......</a></td></tr>
	<tr valign="top" class="swTrOdd"><td>......</td><td><a href="....">......</a></td></tr>
	<tr valign="top" class="swTrEven"><td>......</td><td><a href="....">......</a></td></tr>
		.
		.
		.
	</table>


	Pager line
	----------
	Line of links containing links to other results of search.
	Second link is selected.
	
	<div class="swSearchLinks">&nbsp;
		<a href="...." class="swNavText" >&lt;&lt;&lt;</a>&nbsp;
		<a href="...." class="swNav" >1</a>&nbsp;
		<span class="swNavActual">2</span>&nbsp;
		<a href="...." class="swNav" >3</a>&nbsp;
			.
			.
			.
		<a href="...." class="swNavText" >&gt;&gt;&gt;</a>
	</div>


Smarty template engine
======================
 If you are not satisfied by changes which you could do via editing CSS styles,
you have to change smarty templates. The documentation for smarty you can found
here: http://smarty.php.net/docs.php It's basic material for study.

 Smarty templates are located in directory 'templates'. The names of files are
ususaly same as names of files from directories 'html/admin' and 'html/user'. 
But the convention is, the templates for admin interface are prepended by 'a_'
and templates for user interface are prepended by 'u_'.

 All the results which should be displayed to user is stored in special 
variables in smarty engine (named smarty variables). It's hard to explain 
content and meaning of all variables. However it is quite documented as comments
in source files of application layer (files in directory application_layer).
The easiest (and recomended) way how to customize serweb is only modify existing 
templates.


	Some notices to html forms
	--------------------------
	Html forms are ususaly stored in variable named 'form' (may by renamed). 
	It is an associative array containig always keys 'start' and 'finish'.
	The variable 'form.start' contain <form ....> tag and variable 'form.finish'
	contain </form> tag. Except these keys variable form contain other keys 
	which are single <input> (or <select>) tags. The names of these keys depends
	on Application Unit which is used on the page. You should study basics of
	Application layer if you want play with this.
	
	The submit element of the form is always stored in variable 'form.okey'. The
	submit element may be <input type="image"> or <input type='submit'> or may
	be hidden. If is hidden it has to be called by javascript function. But it
	have the advantage in customization. It may be for example image (of button)
	which changes on mouse over. For example like this:
		<a href="document.form1.reset();" onmouseover="btnOver();" onmousedown="btnDown();" 
			onmouseup="btnUp();" onmouseout="btnOut();" onfocus="this.blur();">
			<img class="button" src="...." alt="...."></a>
	The type of submit button can be changed by param of application unit
	'form_submit'.
