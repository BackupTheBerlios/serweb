Frequently Asked Installation Questions:
Q: What is the zone.tab file and where is it located.
A: zone.tab describes timezones -- information needed to
   interpret time information correctly. Where it is stored
   depends on your OS, many distributions store it at
   /usr/share/zoneinfo/zone.tab. The file contains line-by-line
   country code, coordinates, names and optional comments, e.g.
   CZ  +5005+01426   Europe/Prague
