serweb - Installation

  Requirements:
  - Apache web server
  - php 4.x and support for mysql (php-mysql package)
  - MySQL 4.0 (we use UNIONs)
  - running SER with MySQL support

  Quick Install:
    [1] Untar the distribution (be sure to untar the subdirectories)
    [2] It is recommended that you don't place the phplib directory in
        the HTML tree on your server.
    [3] Open the file config.php in your favourite editor and change
        the values for host, database name, user and password and
        other values to fit your environment. Refer to and define files 
        (prolog, separator, epilog) that define layout of your webpages.
	[4] make sure your php.ini includes the following values:
	    - short_open_tag = on
		- register_globals = on
    [5] Open the file <your-host>/<your-install-dir>/admin/index.php
        or <your-host>/<your-install-dir>/user_interface/index.php
        in your browser. Serweb should now display a login screen.



Frequently Asked Installation Questions:

Q: What is the zone.tab file and where is it located.
A: zone.tab describes timezones -- information needed to
   interpret time information correctly. Where it is stored
   depends on your OS, many distributions store it at
   /usr/share/zoneinfo/zone.tab. The file contains line-by-line
   country code, coordinates, names and optional comments, e.g.
   CZ  +5005+01426   Europe/Prague
   (You may want to get the file from other places like
    http://rpmfind.net/linux/lorax/i386/RedHat/instimage/usr/share/zoneinfo/zone.tab
    or ftp://elsie.nci.nih.gov/pub/)

Q: I get this error: "call to undefined function :mysql-pconnect()"
A: Do install php-mysql. Really.

Q: All my login attempts lead to the previous screen without any
   kind of progress or error indication.
A: Really make sure that register_globals is turned on in your
   php.ini. (Also make sure that you are changing the php.ini in
   use by your server and register_globals is not turned off
   somewhere else in the configuration file.)
