  Requirements:
  -------------

  - Apache web server
  - php 4.3 and later with support for mysql (php-mysql package)
  - PEAR package DB (should be included in PHP release 4.3 and later)
  - PEAR package LOG (optional - not included in PHP realase)
		see http://pear.php.net/manual/en/installation.getting.php for details
  - MySQL 4.0 (we use UNIONs)
  - running SER with MySQL support


  Quick Install:
  --------------

    [1] Untar the distribution (be sure to untar the subdirectories)
    [2] It is recommended that you don't place the phplib directory in
        the HTML tree on your server.
    [3] Open the file config_data_layer.php in your favourite editor and change
        the values for db_type, db_host, db_name, db_user and db_pass
    [4] Open the file config_paths.php and change value for root_path
        to fit directory in html tree where serweb is installed. Also change
        other values to fit your environment.
    [5] Open the file config.php and see if you wish to change some setting.
        If you want enable loging, make sure that you have installed
        PEAR package LOG
    [6] In subdirectory /your/serweb/dir/html/domains create
        directories named as domains you are hosting a copy to them content
        of subdir /your/serweb/dir/html/domains/_default. In this
        directories is files for domain depended configuration and layout
        of pages for each domain. If some file isn't found in directory
        /your/serweb/dir/html/domains/<domain> is used the one from
        /your/serweb/dir/html/domains/_default
    [7] Open config.php for each domain
        (/your/serweb/dir/html/domains/*/config.php) and change setting
        to fit your environment. Don't forget change email address
        (mail_header_from, infomail, regmail) and contact address of instant
        messages (web_contact)
    [8] make sure your php.ini includes the following values:
            - short_open_tag = on
            - register_globals = on     (in PHP4 is disabled by default)
            - register_long_arrays = on (in PHP5 is disabled by default)
    [9] Open the file <your-host>/<your-install-dir>/admin/index.php
        or <your-host>/<your-install-dir>/user_interface/index.php
        in your browser. Serweb should now display a login screen.
        The initial username is 'admin' with password 'heslo'. Its strongly
        recomended to change this password after first login.
    [10] If everything work, is now time to create cronjobs. Type command
        'crontab -e' at command line which open your crontab file and insert
        lines said in file
        /your/serweb/dir/html/admin/cron_job/cronentry
    [11] You should forbid access to from whole internet to corn_job
         directory. This is done in .htaccess file in this directory, but
         you must allow process of this in your apache configuration by
         directive:
             <Directory "/your/serweb/dir/html/admin/cron_job">
                 AllowOverride Limit
             </Directory>



  Config files notes:
  -------------------

  Config files are readed in this order:
	1. config_paths.php
	2. config_data_layer.php
	3. config.php
	4. domains/<domain>/config.php

  In domain depending config.php can be changed only values said
  in variable 'domain_depend_config' in main config.php. This is
  in order to admins of individual domains can't change other
  config values.

  If you aren't settle for automatic seting domain by server name in
  http request, you can change it in file set_domain.php.


  Frequently Asked Installation Questions:
  ----------------------------------------

  Q: What is the zone.tab file and where is it located.
  A: zone.tab describes timezones -- information needed to
     interpret time information correctly. Where it is stored
     depends on your OS, many distributions store it at
     /usr/share/zoneinfo/zone.tab. The file contains line-by-line
     country code, coordinates, names and optional comments, e.g.
     CZ  +5005+01426   Europe/Prague
     (You may want to get the file from other places like
     http://rpmfind.net/linux/lorax/i386/RedHat/instimage/usr/share/zoneinfo/zone.tab
     or ftp://elsie.nci.nih.gov/pub/)

  Q: I get this error: "call to undefined function :mysql-pconnect()"
  A: Do install php-mysql. Really.

  Q: All my login attempts lead to the previous screen without any
     kind of progress or error indication.
  A: Really make sure that register_globals is turned on in your
     php.ini. (Also make sure that you are changing the php.ini in
     use by your server and register_globals is not turned off
     somewhere else in the configuration file.)
