  Important:
  ----------
  
  	Please keep in mind that using latest CVS version isn't recomended
  	and it is on your own risc. This version is developer and may be unstable and buggy.
  	For get latest stable version use this command:
  	
  	cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.berlios.de:/cvsroot/serweb co -P -r rel_0_10_0 serweb


  Quick Install:
  --------------

    [1] Untar the distribution (be sure to untar the subdirectories)
        and copy the Overlib library into directory /your/serweb/dir/html/js/overlib

    [2] It is recommended to be only 'html' directory accessible throught the 
	    HTML tree on your server. And leave other directories unaccessible
	    throught http. Do it by creating alias in your httpd.conf,
		for example:
	    	Alias /serweb "/your/serweb/dir/html" 
	    	
	    notice: If you are intending use serweb with multidomain support, skip 
	            this step. And instead of it follow instructions in file
	            mudules/multidomain/README

    [3] Open the file config_data_layer.php in your favourite editor and change
        the values for db_type, db_host, db_name, db_user and db_pass

    [4] Open the file config_paths.php and change value for root_path
        to fit directory in html tree where serweb is installed. Also change
        other values to fit your environment.

    [5] Open the file config.php and see if you wish to change some setting.
        If you want enable logging, make sure that you have installed
        PEAR package LOG. Make sure that your web server daemon has rights
        to write to file /var/log/serweb. Type these two commands:
            touch /var/log/serweb
            chown www-data /var/log/serweb

    [6] There are some config options which are specific for individual domains
        in multidomain setup. If you are intending to use serweb in multidomain
        setup look for detailed info in file mudules/multidomain/README. 
		Otherwise if you will use serweb only for a single domain change these
		options in file html/domains/_default/config.ini.php
	    
    [7] make sure your php.ini includes the following values:
            - short_open_tag = on

	[8] create initial admin account - see README file for details
            
    [9] Open the file http://<your-host>/<your-install-dir>/admin/index.php
        or http://<your-host>/<your-install-dir>/user/index.php
        in your browser. Serweb should now display a login screen.
        The initial username is 'admin@_default_' with password 'heslo'. Its 
		strongly recomended to change this password after first login.
        
        Notice: Do not replace '<your-host>' in url mentioned above by
        'localhost'. Use real name of the server instead of 'localhost'!!
		It is because serweb obtail domainname from this url and the domainname
		is also used for user authentication.
        
    [10] If everything work, is now time to create cronjobs. Follow instructions 
	    in file scripts/cron_job/INSTALL
	    

  Config files notes:
  -------------------

  Config files are readed in this order:
	1. config_paths.php
	2. config_data_layer.php
	3. config.php
	4. domains/<domain>/config.php

  In domain depending config.php can be changed only values said
  in variable 'domain_depend_config' in main config.php. This is
  in order to admins of individual domains can't change other
  config values.

  If you aren't settle for automatic seting domain by server name in
  http request, you can change it in file set_domain.php.
