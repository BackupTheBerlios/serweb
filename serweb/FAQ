  Frequently Asked Installation Questions:
  ----------------------------------------

  Q: What is the zone.tab file and where is it located.
  A: zone.tab describes timezones -- information needed to
     interpret time information correctly. Where it is stored
     depends on your OS, many distributions store it at
     /usr/share/zoneinfo/zone.tab. The file contains line-by-line
     country code, coordinates, names and optional comments, e.g.
     CZ  +5005+01426   Europe/Prague
     (You may want to get the file from other places like
     http://rpmfind.net/linux/lorax/i386/RedHat/instimage/usr/share/zoneinfo/zone.tab
     or ftp://elsie.nci.nih.gov/pub/)

  Q: I get this error: "call to undefined function :mysql-pconnect()"
  A: Do install php-mysql. Really.

  Q: I can't login into serweb by default username and password
  A: Please make sure your username, password and domain values are exactly 
     matched the values of your credentials table.
       Probably your domain do not match. Serweb obtain domain 
     from http request by default. So the host in http request should
     be same as you are useing in SER. For details see file
     config/set_domain.php. You can also disable automatic obtaining
     domain and set it by hand here.

  Q: Still can't login into serweb by default username and password
  A: Enable logging in serweb ($config->enable_logging = true) and
     see log file. For more verbosity set log level to PEAR_LOG_DEBUG

  Q: When new user is subscribing throught serweb, still same alias is assigned
     to him.
  A: Make sure that usrloc module in ser is useing domain. Look up for this 
     option in your ser.cfg:
     
	 modparam("usrloc|registrar", "use_domain", 1)
 
  Q: How can I install PECL package Classkit?
  A: Type this command on command line:
       
	   pear install -f classkit
       
     If you get an error mentioning "phpize" you also might need to install 
	 some dev package, like php4-dev on Debian systems.
 
  Q: Package Classkit is installed, but serweb still reporting:
     Function aggregate_methods() doesn't exists. Try install Classkit extension. 
  A: Check if module is loaded in PHP. Check your php.ini for something like 
     this:
       extension=classkit.so
  
  Q: Serweb show error "DB Error: syntax error" on 'missed call' and 
     'accounting' tab.
  A: Check version of your mysql. Serweb need mysql >= 4.0
